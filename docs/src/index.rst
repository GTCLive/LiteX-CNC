Litex-CNC
=========

This project aims to make a generic CNC firmware and driver for FPGA cards which are supported by
LiteX. Configuration of the board and driver is done using json-files. The supported boards are the
Colorlight boards 5A-75B and 5A-75E, as these are fully supported with the open source toolchain.
